Some things I had to fix in order to get this running on a 
clean Raspberry Pi.

- Run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales` to fix the locales issue. Install 'en-US UTF-8' and set as default.
- apt-get install screen.
- Clone raspi whatsapp repo (https://github.com/noio/RaspiWhatsApp.git)
- Get easy_install (setuptools) for Python:
    
    wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/0.7.4/ez_setup.py -O - | python

- `sudo easy_install pip`
- `pip install pyusb`
